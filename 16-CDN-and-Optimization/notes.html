<h2>CloudFront</h2>
<h3>Architecture Basics</h3>
<p>Cloudfront is a global object cache, also known as a content delivery network (CDN)</p>
<p>Content is cached in locations close to customers.
If the content is not available on the local cache when requested, ClouldFront
will pull and cache it then.</p>
<p>This provides lower latency and higher throughput for customers.</p>
<p>Can handle static and dynamic content.</p>
<p><strong>Origin</strong>  the source location of your content
<strong>Distribution</strong> the configuration unit of CloudFront
Edge locations - local infrastructure which hosts a cache of your data.
There are over 200 edge locations. They can be one or more racks in a
third party server system.</p>
<p>Regional Edge Cache - larger version of an edge location. Provides
another layer of caching.</p>
<h4>Caching Optimisation</h4>
<p>Parameters can be passed on the url such as query string parameter.
An example is <code>?language=en</code> and <code>?language=es</code></p>
<p>To get the cached copy, you need to use the same query strings. If you do
use them, ensure the strings are in the same order.</p>
<h3>AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</h3>
<ul>
<li>HTTP lacks encryption and is insecure</li>
<li>HTTPS uses SSL/TLS layer of encryption added to HTTP</li>
<li>Data is encrypted in-transit</li>
<li>Certificates allow servers to prove their identity</li>
<li>Signed by a trusted authority (CA).</li>
<li>To be secure, a website generates a certificate and has a CA sign it. The
website then uses that certificate to prove its authenticity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Create, renew, and deploy certificates with ACM.</p>
<p>Supported AWS services ONLY (CloudFront and ALB, NOT EC2)</p>
<p>If it's not a managed service, ACM doesn't support it.</p>
<p>Cloudfront must have a trusted and signed certificate. It can't be self signed.</p>
<h3>Origin Access Identity (OAI)</h3>
<p>This identity can be associated with a cloud front distribution.</p>
<p>The edge locations gain this identity.</p>
<p>We then remove the explicit allows and only allow the OAI to use it.</p>
<p>Best practice is to create one per distribution to manage permissions.</p>
<h3>AWS Global Accelerator</h3>
<p>Starts with 2 <strong>anycast</strong> IP address
1.2.3.4 &amp; 4.3.2.1</p>
<p>Anycast IP's allow a single IP to be in multiple locations.
Routing moves traffic to closest location.</p>
<p>Traffic initially uses public internet and enters a global
accelerator edge location.</p>
<h4>Key concepts</h4>
<p>Move the AWS network closer to customers.</p>
<p>Global Accelerator moves the AWS network as close as possible.</p>
<p>Connections enter at edge, using anycast IPs. Transit over AWS backbone to 1+
locations.</p>
<p>Global Accelerator is a network product. Can use TCP, UDP.</p>
<p>Caching is mostly CloudFront. TCP and UDP is mostly Global Accelerator</p>
