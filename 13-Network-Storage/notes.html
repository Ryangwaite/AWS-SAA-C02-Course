<h2>Network Storage</h2>
<h3>EFS Architecture</h3>
<p>EFS moves the instances closer to a stateless.</p>
<p>EFS is an implementation of NFSv4</p>
<p>EFS Filesystems can be mounted in Linux.</p>
<p>Using Amazon EFS with Microsoft Windowsâ€“based Amazon EC2 instances is not supported.</p>
<p>Media can be shared between many EC2 instances.</p>
<p>This is a private service, access is via mount targets inside a VPC.</p>
<p>You can access from on-premises with VPN or DX so long as access is configured.</p>
<h4>Elastic File System Explained</h4>
<p>EFS runs inside a VPC.
EFS includes POSIX permissions. These are made available via mount targets.</p>
<p>For a fully highly available system you need a mount target for each AZ the
system runs in.</p>
<p>You can use hybrid networking to connect to the same mount targets.</p>
<h4>EFS Exam Powerup</h4>
<p>EFS is Linux Only</p>
<p>Two performance modes, general purpose and max I/O performance mode.</p>
<p>General purpose = default for 99.9% of uses</p>
<p>Bursting and provisioned throughput modes.</p>
<p>Two storage classes available, standard and infrequent access.</p>
<p>Lifecycle policies can move data between EFS</p>
